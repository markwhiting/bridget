title: Shoes as Marionettes

As a final project in an internship at the Puppet Theatre Barge, a marionette theatre in London, I made my first performance with shoes. Marionette Shoes.

A Little Shoe preparing her stage and herself for a performance is suddenly interrupted by the entrance of a Big Boot. At first dubious, it takes some time for the Little Shoe to acknowledge this new arrival, but, after she cleans him, she accepts him, even letting him join in her dance. They dance together to Fats Waller singing “Your Feet’s too Big”. By the end they are friends. At the very end, however, Sock comes on for the curtain call, taking all the applause..… This project was successful because of clear directing.
