The Princess, tired of her ice confined within the palace domain, controlled by servants and restricted by etiquette lessons, would much prefer to be playing in the mud outside. When her ball bounces over the palace garden walls she is determined to follow it, into the forest where, inevitably she meets a frog. Do you think they will be friends?

I enjoyed working as a Director's Assistant to director Rene Baker: my role was as a facilitator
charged with keeping everything running smoothly: making tea at appropriate moments, recording the process of rehearsal in short films with additional photos of key elements, while striving to capture any practical arrangements or movements to which Baker drew attention. In addition, I noted down lines said by the actor puppeteers and transformed this improvisation into text. I had the satisfying role of making everything just slightly less hectic plus getting access to all the behind scene conversation. I could thus watch Baker, observing how she spoke to the puppeteers and puppets, noting how much or how little she chose to say and how far she would decide to work with or around a performerâ€™s limitations. Baker always had a clear idea but not so clearly defined as to eliminate flexibility in the creation.
