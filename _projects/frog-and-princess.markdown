The Princess, tired of her life confined within the palace domain - controlled by servants and restricted by etiquette lessons - would prefer to be playing in the mud outside. When her ball bounces over the palace garden walls she is determined to follow it, into the forest where, inevitably she meets the Frog. Do you think they will be friends?

In this project I worked as director's assistant to director Rene Baker.
A role charged with keeping everything running smoothly: making tea at appropriate moments, recording the process of rehearsal in short films with additional photos of key elements, while striving to capture any practical arrangements or movements to which Baker drew attention. In addition, I noted down lines said by the actor puppeteers and transformed this improvisation into text. I had the satisfying role of making everything just slightly less hectic and getting access to all the behind scene conversation and observing the directing process.
