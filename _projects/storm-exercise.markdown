A live Foley soundscape performed at the opening night of Low Batt., an exhibition at the [TURF](http://turf-projects.com/about-turf/) gallery in London exposing our dependency on technology.

At first there is a wind, then a patter of rain which grows into a storm. The wind incresses and a window brakes. The sound of what must be the sea becomes louder. Gradually the storm subsides, only the calm water lapping remains.
