A Nose on a walk.
A Nose dissatisfied with its place, firmly secured to the center of a face, decides to go for a walk, to have an adventure. It is an adventure that turns into a chase when the Nose’s owner discovers it/he is missing. An adventure of new smells, of floating in a river, meeting a dog and a rather frightening policeman. The owner of the Nose is on his own journey: why did my nose leave; look at all these new places and things I am discovering …
The two are reunited in the end, somehow…. Do you think they have been changed by the experience?

The Nose, inspired by Gogol’s short story, was devised through a process of material exploration, play and improvisation.
I was a performer, a puppet manipulator, as well as the designer
and maker of the costumes for the cast.
