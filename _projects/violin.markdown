Puppet performance devised from Vladimir Mayakovskiy’s poem, “The Violin — A Little Bit Nervous” performed to Paganini’s ‘La campanella’.

A Violin becomes overworked, its player walks away. Lonely, the Violin does not notice its other half — its soul-mate —emerging from the darkness. She dances. They are finally united.

Wonderful playful poem.
