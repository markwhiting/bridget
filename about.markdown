Apart from theatre Bridget is an avid social dancer. Elements shared in both areas — theatre and dance — are connection, rhythm and Bridget’s deep concentration of cultivating laughter.

> “Laughter has a deep philosophical meaning, it is one of the essential forms of the truth concerning the world as a whole, concerning history and man; it is a peculiar point of view relative to the world; the world is seen anew, no less (and perhaps more) profoundly than when seen from the serious standpoint. Therefore, laughter is just as admissible in great literature, posing universal problems, as seriousness. Certain essential aspects of the world are accessible only to laughter.” – **Rabelais and His World —Bahktin**
