A recent graduate of Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in Puppetry, Bridget Whiting is an emerging interdisciplinary artist with an interest in object theatre, Foley, stop-motion and opera.

She has collaborated in Slovakia, France and England, and is always eager to travel in order to further connections and experience different ways of doing things.

She sees theatre and dance as the gears which bring connection and rhythm to her process. The object of her work is the cultivation of laughter. Deep laughter.

> “Laughter has a deep philosophical meaning, it is one of the essential forms of the truth concerning the world as a whole, concerning history and man; it is a peculiar point of view relative to the world; the world is seen anew, no less (and perhaps more) profoundly than when seen from the serious standpoint. Therefore, laughter is just as admissible in great literature, posing universal problems, as seriousness. Certain essential aspects of the world are accessible only to laughter.”
