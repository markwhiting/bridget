visual and written evidence of your own specialism within puppetry

What is puppetry? My interest in puppetry is not as a therapy and not as a craft directed mainly towards children, but as an art form: a pure and challenging art. That is not to say that it is without humor; humor, irony and satire, is its compelling attraction. It is a humor very much based on the unexpected, which is the strength of object theatre when, suddenly, we become attracted and attached to an inanimate object. It is the same bond which the puppeteer seeks to establish using so called "made puppets"; comparison with object theatre simply highlights the drive to find the hidden character of objects. Revealing character requires the use of significant gesture: how to establish a character through fossilizing the gestural atmosphere which surrounds it. The practice of puppetry thus involves the insight of mime and even dance. Puppetry is an art form which seeks to establish a profound emotional connection by touching on truth through the creation of an artificial but highly reactive space. The article of puppetry should be dedicated to taking the viewer to a zone where movement, gesture and object become united in creating meaning. It is in a place — a renowned space — such as Wigmore Hall listening to Ian Bostridge singing Hugo Wolf accompanied by Julius Drake with a program in hand with all the songs written out with their translations that the observer, me, feels a buzz of excitement, a deep engagement with the moment. The question arises: How can Puppetry reach this level of concentration?
